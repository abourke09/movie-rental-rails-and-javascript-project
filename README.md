Movie Rental Rails Project
Welcome to the Movie Rental Rails Project. This Ruby on Rails web application will allow you to log in and select a movie to rent. You'll be able to sign up or log in (with Facebook if you choose), then select, rent, and return a movie. You can also record a famous quote from a movie you've rented after you return it. The platform will only allow you to rent a movie that you are old enough to watch (based on the MPAA rating system).

Usage
First, fork and clone this repository on GitHub. Once you CD into movie-rental-rails-project from your command line, run the following commands:
`bundle install`

Finally, visit http://localhost:3000/ on your browser to use the app's homepage.
