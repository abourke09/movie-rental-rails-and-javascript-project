Movie Rental Rails & Javascript Project
======================================

Application Description
---------------
Welcome to the Movie Rental Rails & Javascript Project. This Ruby on Rails web app incorporates Javascript and JSON APIs to give the user a dynamic movie rental experience. The user can sign up or log in, then select, rent, and return a movie. The user can also save a famous quote once they've returned a movie. The platform will only allow a user to rent a movie that they are old enough to watch (based on the MPAA rating system).

Usage & Installation Guide
---------------
First, fork and clone this repository on GitHub. Once you CD into `movie-rental-rails--and-javascript-project` from your command line, run the following commands:

```
  bundle install       
  rails s   
```  

Finally, visit <http://localhost:3000/> on your browser to view the app's homepage.
